<!--
Template for pull requests written by an AI agent.

Title:
- English, imperative mood, sentence case, no trailing period.
- No Conventional Commits prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, ...) in the title, even though commit messages use one.
- Name the affected app or area in plain words, e.g. "Log Credential Manager failures in the Android app",
  "Serve karasu256.com's assetlinks.json from api.karasu256.com".

Body:
- English, written in full sentences. Explain why the change was needed, not only what changed.
- Open the Summary with the previous behavior or problem, then what this pull request does about it.
- Group details under short bold headings (one per area or file group), each followed by a bullet list.
  Reference files, classes, functions, and commands in backticks.
- Call out deliberate limitations, behavior left unchanged, and anything not done yet.
- Test plan: check only what was actually run (builds, type checks, tests). Leave on-device or
  in-browser checks that were not performed unchecked.
- End with the attribution footer required by the active session's instructions, unchanged.
- Delete this comment block.
